# SNHU-Proj-3
Project 3 SNHU c++ program

- The goal of this project was to update items that were purchased throughout the day to gather the frequency in which they were ordered.
- I was able to achieve the ability to correctly navigate the menu in desired effect to show in list form the current frequency, while also showing a chart
- This code however could use improvement in the area of a more user friendly display, this could help make it easier to navigate and better to look at
- The most challenging part of this project honestly was getting the program to pull the txt file as I didn't remember where to place it
- This project gave me the skills to understand how to properly label a program so it is easy to understand when looking at it later
- I was able to make this program readable and maintaible by adding notes and comments within the code so that each function is clearly listed out
